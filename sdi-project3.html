<p>I have done my story about my running group that meets once a week.  We talk about how to breath when you run, best places to run, and anything that has to do with running.  We are always welcoming new members that want to get into running but have never ran before.  I have kept with the theme of running for this story.  Last time it was about running a race, this time it is about my running group.</p>
